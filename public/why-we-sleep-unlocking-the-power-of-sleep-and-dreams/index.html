<h2>Mes highlights</h2> 
<br>


<hr>
<p>Sleep further regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food selection rather than rash impulsivity</p>
<hr>
<p>this temperature rhythm is not dependent upon whether you are actually asleep. If I were to keep you awake all night, your core body temperature would still show the same pattern.</p>
<hr>
<p>Others are
“evening types,” and account for approximately 30 percent of the population. They naturally prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late the following morning, or even in the
afternoon</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are a night owl, it’s likely that one (or both) of your parents is a night owl. Sadly, society treats night owls rather unfairly on two counts</p>
<hr>
<p>Most unfortunately, owls are more chronically sleep-deprived, having to wake up with the larks, but not being able to fall asleep until far later in the evening</p>
<hr>
<p>The night owls in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning larks, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m.</p>
<hr>
<p>There may be little, if any, quality melatonin in the pill. That said, there is a significant sleep placebo effect of melatonin, which should not be underestimated: the placebo effect is, after all, the most reliable effect in all of pharmacology.</p>
<hr>
<p>parts of their brains—
specifically those related to learning and memory—had physically shrunk, suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of time-zone travel</p>
<hr>
<p>Second, their short-term memory was significantly impaired. They were considerably more forgetful than individuals of similar age and background who did not frequently travel through time zones</p>
<hr>
<p>increasing adenosine in the brain is an increasing desire to sleep. This is known as sleep pressure, and it is the second force that will determine when you feel sleepy, and thus should go to bed</p>
<hr>
<p>artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that makes you feel more alert and awake: caffeine</p>
<hr>
<p>Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours.</p>
<hr>
<p>the older we are, the longer it takes our brain and body to remove caffeine, and thus the more sensitive we become in later life to caffeine’s sleep-disrupting influence.</p>
<hr>
<p>The researchers noted how strikingly incapable the spiders were in constructing anything resembling a normal or logical web that would be of any functional use when given caffeine, even relative to other potent drugs tested.</p>
<hr>
<p>answer resides with your twenty-four-hour circadian rhythm, which offers a brief period of salvation from sleepiness. Unlike sleep pressure, your circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are asleep or awake. Its slow, rhythmic countenance continues to fall and rise strictly on the basis of what time of night or day it is. No matter what state of adenosine sleepiness pressure exists within the brain, the twenty-four-hour circadian rhythm cycles on as per usual</p>
<hr>
<p>could you fall back asleep at ten or eleven a.m.? If the answer is “yes,” you are likely not getting sufficient sleep</p>
<hr>
<p>can you function optimally without caffeine before noon? If the answer is “no,” then you are most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation</p>
<hr>
<p>non–rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep, and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep</p>
<hr>
<p>REM sleep in the last part of the night, which is to say the late-morning hours, you will lose 60 to 90 percent of all your REM sleep, even though you are losing 25 percent of your total sleep time. It works both ways. If you wake up at eight a.m., but don’t go to bed until two a.m., then you lose a significant amount of deep NREM sleep</p>
<hr>
<p>The brainwaves are really that asynchronous—their drumbeat has no discernible rhythm</p>
<hr>
<p>REM sleep brain activity is an almost perfect replica of that seen during attentive, alert wakefulness</p>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM
sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).</p>
<hr>
<p>This striking dissociation during the dreaming state, where the brain is highly active but the body is immobilized, allows sleep scientists to easily recognize—and therefore separate—REM-sleep brainwaves from wakeful ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>REM-sleep dreaming came into being, what vital needs it supports in the warm-blooded world of birds and mammals (e.g., cardiovascular health, emotional restoration, memory association, creativity, body-temperature regulation)</p>
<hr>
<p>We try to recover one (NREM) a little sooner than the other (REM), but make no mistake, the brain will attempt to recoup both, trying to salvage some of the losses incurred.</p>
<hr>
<p>the brain never comes close to getting back all the sleep it has lost.</p>
<hr>
<p>But if you bring that person into a sleep laboratory, or take them to a hotel—both of which are unfamiliar sleep environments—one half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the other</p>
<hr>
<p>However, those that abandoned regular siestas went on to suffer a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across the six-year period, relative to those who maintained regular daytime naps.</p>
<hr>
<p>Between 20 and 25 percent of our sleep time is dedicated to REM sleep dreaming, compared to an average of only 9 percent across all other primates!</p>
<hr>
<p>the coolheaded ability to regulate our emotions each day—a key to what we call emotional IQ—depends on getting sufficient REM sleep night after night</p>
<hr>
<p>NREM sleep helps transfer and make safe newly learned information into long-term storage sites of the brain</p>
<hr>
<p>REM sleep helps construct vast associative networks of information within the brain.</p>
<hr>
<p>We can awake the next morning with new solutions to previously intractable problems or even be infused with radically new and original ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep that we know of.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are now wondering whether or not epidemiological studies have linked alcohol use during pregnancy and an increased likelihood of neuropsychiatric illness in the mother’s child, including autism, the answer is yes</p>
<hr>
<p>Concentrations of alcohol in breast milk closely resemble those in a mother’s bloodstream: a 0.08 blood alcohol level in a mother will result in approximately a 0.08 alcohol level in breast milk.</p>
<hr>
<p>Only that blocking or reducing REM sleep in newborn animals hinders and distorts brain development, leading to an adult that is socially abnormal.</p>
<hr>
<p>That balance will finally stabilize to an 80/20 NREM/REM sleep split by the late teen years, and remain so throughout early and midadulthood</p>
<hr>
<p>Therefore, the back of the brain of an adolescent was more adult-like, while the front of the brain remained more child-like at any one moment during this developmental window of time</p>
<hr>
<p>The reason is not simply that children need more sleep than their older siblings or parents, but also that the circadian rhythm of a young child runs on an earlier schedule. Children therefore become sleepy earlier and wake up earlier than their adult parents.</p>
<hr>
<p>During puberty, the timing of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is shifted progressively forward: a change that is common across all adolescents, irrespective of culture or geography. So far forward, in fact, it passes even the timing of their adult parents.</p>
<hr>
<p>asking your teenage son or daughter to go to bed and fall asleep at ten p.m. is the circadian equivalent of asking you, their parent, to go to sleep at seven or eight p.m.</p>
<hr>
<p>As healthy teenagers, we enjoyed a sleep efficiency of about 95 percent. As a reference anchor, most sleep doctors consider good-quality sleep to involve a sleep efficiency of 90 percent or above.</p>
<hr>
<p>More generally, these and similar studies have confirmed that poor sleep is one of the most underappreciated factors contributing to cognitive and medical ill health in the elderly, including issues of diabetes, depression, chronic pain, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<hr>
<p>The memory refreshment was related to lighter, stage 2 NREM sleep, and specifically the short, powerful bursts of electrical activity called sleep spindles</p>
<hr>
<p>those who napped did markedly better, and actually improved in
their capacity to memorize facts. The difference between the two groups at six p.m. was not small: a 20 percent learning advantage for those who slept.</p>
<hr>
<p>the more sleep spindles an individual has at night, the greater the restoration of overnight learning ability come the next morning.</p>
<hr>
<p>the concentration of NREM-sleep spindles is especially rich in the late-morning hours, sandwiched between long periods of REM sleep.</p>
<hr>
<p>the result was clear. It was early-night sleep, rich in deep NREM, that won out in terms of providing superior memory retenti</p>
<hr>
<p>the more deep NREM sleep, the more information an individual remembered the next day</p>
<hr>
<p>Even daytime naps as short as twenty minutes can offer a memory consolidation advantage, so long as they contain enough NREM sleep. V</p>
<hr>
<p>In other words, following a night of sleep you regain access to memories that you could not retrieve before sleep</p>
<hr>
<p>By boosting the electrical quality of deep-sleep brainwave activity, the researchers almost doubled the number of facts that individuals were able to recall the following day, relative to those participants who received no stimulation</p>
<hr>
<p>Nevertheless, the findings offer a scientific explanation for the ancient practice of rocking a child back and forth in one’s arms, or in a crib, inducing a deep sleep.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before going to bed, you would review the learning experiences of the day, selecting only those memories from the menu list that you would like improved. You place your order, then go to sleep, knowing that your order will be served to you overnight.</p>
<hr>
<p>targeted memory reactivation</p>
<hr>
<p>you will have a quite remarkable bias in your recollection, remembering far more of the items that we reactivated during sleep using the sound cues than those not reactivated</p>
<hr>
<p>Sleep powerfully, yet very selectively, boosted the retention of those words previously tagged for “remembering,” yet actively avoided the strengthening of those memories tagged for “forgetting.” Participants who did not sleep showed no such impressive parsing and differential saving of the memories</p>
<hr>
<p>those who were tested after the very same time delay of twelve hours, but that spanned a night of sleep, showed a striking 20
percent jump in performance speed and a near 35 percent improvement in accuracy.</p>
<hr>
<p>in the last two hours of the late morning—the time of night with the richest spindle bursts of brainwave activity—that were linked with the offline memory boost.</p>
<hr>
<p>Post-performance sleep accelerates physical recovery from common inflammation, stimulates muscle repair, and helps restock cellular energy in the form of glucose and glycogen.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the first night of no sleep at all, their lapses in concentration (missed responses) increased by over 400 percent.</p>
<hr>
<p>YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW SLEEP-DEPRIVED YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE SLEEP-DEPRIVED</p>
<hr>
<p>With chronic sleep restriction over months or years, an individual will actually acclimate to their impaired performance, lower alertness, and reduced energy levels.</p>
<hr>
<p>After being awake for nineteen hours, people who were sleep-deprived were as cognitively impaired as those who were legally drunk.</p>
<hr>
<p>After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail.</p>
<hr>
<p>But in the subsequent studies that Dinges and many other researchers (myself included) have performed, neither naps nor caffeine can salvage more complex functions of the brain, including learning, memory, emotional stability, complex reasoning, or decision-making.</p>
<hr>
<p>60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in the participants who were sleep-deprived</p>
<hr>
<p>prefrontal cortex—the region of the brain that sits just above your eyeballs; is most developed in humans, relative to other primates; and is associated with rational, logical thought and decision-making—was strongly coupled to the amygdala, regulating this deep emotional brain center with inhibitory control</p>
<hr>
<p>However, a prevailing view in psychiatry has been that mental disorders cause sleep disruption—a one-way street of influence. Instead, we have demonstrated that otherwise healthy people can experience a neurological pattern of brain activity similar to that observed in many of these psychiatric conditions simply by having their sleep disrupted or blocked</p>
<hr>
<p>you discover that this seemingly trivial sleep reduction comes with a frightening spike in heart attacks the following day</p>
<hr>
<p>sleeping less than seven or eight hours a night will increase your probability of gaining weight, being overweight, or being obese, and significantly increases your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
<hr>
<p>the research groups found far higher rates of type 2 diabetes among individuals that reported sleeping less than six hours a night routinely</p>
<hr>
<p>Like marijuana use, these chemicals stimulate appetite and increase your desire to snack, otherwise known as having the munchies.</p>
<hr>
<p>Take it to the extreme by sleep-depriving an individual for twenty-four hours straight and they will only burn an extra 147
calories, relative to a twenty-four-hour period containing a full eight hours of sleep. Sleep, it turns out, is an intensely metabolically active state for brain and body alike.</p>
<hr>
<p>we discovered that supervisory regions in the prefrontal cortex required for thoughtful judgments and controlled decisions had been silenced in their activity by a lack of sleep</p>
<hr>
<p>High-calorie foods became significantly more desirable in the eyes of the participants when sleep-deprived</p>
<hr>
<p>World Health Organization has officially classified nighttime shift work as a “probable carcinogen.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Between 35 and 55 percent of emotional themes and concerns that participants were having while they were awake during the day powerfully and unambiguously resurfaced in the dreams they were having at night.</p>
<hr>
<p>A lot, it turns out. Even a hint of dim light—8 to 10 lux—has been shown to delay the release of nighttime melatonin in humans</p>
<hr>
<p>Compared to reading a printed book, reading on an iPad suppressed melatonin release by over 50 percent at night</p>
<hr>
<p>People consuming even moderate amounts of alcohol in the afternoon and/or evening are thus depriving themselves of dream sleep.</p>
<hr>
<p>A bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3°C) is ideal for the sleep of most people, assuming standard bedding and clothing</p>
<hr>
<p>. In younger, healthy adults, exercise frequently increases total sleep time, especially deep NREM sleep</p>
<hr>
<p>When sleep was poor the night prior, exercise intensity and duration were far worse the following day</p>
<hr>
<p>In a carefully controlled study of healthy adult individuals, a four-day diet high in
sugar and other carbohydrates, but low in fiber, resulted in less deep NREM sleep and more awakenings at night</p>
<hr>
<p>A hundred years ago, less than 2 percent of the population in the United States slept six hours or less a night. Now, almost 30 percent of American adults do.</p>
<hr>
<p>individuals who obtained less sleep in the preceding days are the same people who consistently select less challenging problems</p>
<hr>
<p>The irony that employees miss is that when you are not getting enough sleep, you work less productively and thus need to work longer to accomplish a goal</p>
<hr>
<p>perhaps the reason they still have so much to do at the end of the day is precisely because they do not get enough sleep at night.</p>
<hr>
<p>employees who sleep six hours or less are significantly more deviant and more likely to lie the following day than those who sleep six hours or more</p>
<hr>
<p>In the mid-1990s, NASA refined the science of sleeping on the job for the benefit of their astronauts. They discovered that naps as short as twenty-six minutes in length still offered a 34
percent improvement in task performance and more than a 50 percent increase in overall alertness</p>
<hr>
<p>REM sleep is what stands between rationality and insanity</p>
<hr>
<p>we show each individual how their own sleep is a direct predictor of their own physical and mental health. It’s likely that, if you wore such a device, you would find out that on the nights you slept more you ate less food the next day</p>
<hr>
<p>track an individual’s sleep</p>
