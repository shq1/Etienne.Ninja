<h2>Mes highlights</h2> 
<br>


<p>But if you were born in 1990, inflation has been so low for your whole life that it’s probably never crossed your mind.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some people are born into families that encourage education; others are against it. Some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bernie Madoff’s legitimate, non-fraudulent business was by any measure a huge success. It made him hugely—and legitimately—wealthy.
And yet, the fraud.
The question we should ask of both Gupta and Madoff is why someone worth hundreds of millions of dollars would be so desperate for more money that they risked everything in pursuit of even more.</p>
<hr>
<p>And they threw it all away because they wanted more.
They had no sense of enough.</p>
<hr>
<p>The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.</p>
<hr>
<p>But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough</p>
<hr>
<p>Don’t get too attached to anything—your reputation, your accomplishments or any of it. I think about it now, what does it matter? O.K., this thing unjustly destroyed my reputation. That’s only troubling if I am so attached to my reputation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Buffett’s fortune isn’t due to just being a good investor, but being a good investor since he was literally a child.</p>
<hr>
<p>Buffett is the richest investor of all time. But he’s not actually the greatest—at least not when measured by average annual returns.
Jim Simons, head of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, has compounded money at 66% annually since 1988. No one comes close to this record. As we just saw, Buffett has compounded at roughly 22% annually, a third as much.</p>
<hr>
<p>But good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild.</p>
<hr>
<p>They were both very good at getting wealthy, and equally bad at staying wealthy.</p>
<hr>
<p>If I had to summarize money success in a single word it would be “survival.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Capitalism is hard. But part of the reason this happens is because getting money and keeping money are two different skills.
Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there.
But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast.</p>
<hr>
<p>The great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge.</p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps 99% of the works someone like Berggruen acquired in his life turned out to be of little value. But that doesn’t particularly matter if the other 1% turn out to be the work of someone like Picasso. Berggruen could be wrong most of the time and still end up stupendously right.</p>
<hr>
<p>A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.</p>
<hr>
<p>More than your salary. More than the size of your house. More than the prestige of your job. Control over doing what you want, when you want to, with the people you want to, is the broadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1870, 46% of jobs were in agriculture, and 35% were in crafts or manufacturing, according to economist Robert Gordon. Few professions relied on a worker’s brain. You didn’t think; you labored, without interruption, and your work was visible and tangible.
Today, that’s flipped.
Thirty-eight percent of jobs are now designated as “managers, officials, and professionals.” These are decision-making jobs. Another 41% are service jobs that often rely on your thoughts as much as your actions.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired</p>
<hr>
<p>You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration from other people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—especially from the people you want to respect and admire you</p>
<hr>
<p>Past a certain level of income people fall into three groups: Those who save, those who don’t think they can save, and those who don’t think they need to save.</p>
<hr>
<p>building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.</p>
<hr>
<p>Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.</p>
<hr>
<p>you don’t need a specific reason to save.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are human. We don’t like to think harder than we need to, and we have unceasing demands on our attention</p>
<hr>
<p>The historical odds of making money in U.S. markets are 50/50 over one-day periods, 68% in one-year periods, 88% in 10-year periods, and (so far) 100% in 20-year periods</p>
<hr>
<p>“Things that have never happened before happen all the time.”</p>
<hr>
<p>experience leads to overconfidence more than forecasting ability.</p>
<hr>
<p>you don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s fine to save for a car, or a home, or for retirement. But it’s equally important to save for things you can’t possibly predict or even comprehend</p>
<hr>
<p>Imagining a goal is easy and fun. Imagining a goal in the context of the realistic life stresses that grow with competitive pursuits is something entirely different.</p>
<hr>
<p>admit that you, yourself, don’t know today what you will even want in the future</p>
<hr>
<p>people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires, and goals are likely to change in the future</p>
<hr>
<p>But many of us evolve so much over a lifetime that we don’t want to keep doing the same thing for decades on end. Or anything close to it. So rather than one 80-something-year lifespan, our money has perhaps four distinct 20-year blocks.</p>
<hr>
<p>We should also come to accept the reality of changing our minds. Some of the most miserable workers I’ve met are people who stay loyal to a career only because it’s the field they picked when deciding on a college major at age 18. When you accept the End of History Illusion, you realize that the odds of picking a job when you’re not old enough to drink that you will still enjoy when you’re old enough to qualify for Social Security are low.</p>
<hr>
<p>The trick is to accept the reality of change and move on as soon as possible.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Hold stocks for the long run,” you’ll hear. It’s good advice.
But do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing?</p>
<hr>
<p>Immelt told his successor, “Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The question is: Why do so many people who are willing to pay the price of cars, houses, food, and vacations try so hard to avoid paying the price of good investment returns?
The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good</p>
<hr>
<p>The trick is convincing yourself that the market’s fee is worth it</p>
<hr>
<p>Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game than they are.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term.
That process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-term returns, they attract even more traders. Before long—and it often doesn’t take long—the dominant market price-setters with the most authority are those with shorter time horizons.
Bubbles aren’t so much about valuations rising. That’s just a symptom of something else: time horizons shrinking as more short-term traders enter the playing field.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s hard to justify paying $700,000 for a two-bedroom Florida track home to raise your family in for the next 10 years. But it makes perfect sense if you plan on flipping the home in a few months into a market with rising prices to make a quick profit. Which is exactly what many people were doing during the bubble.</p>
<hr>
<p>What you don’t realize is that the traders who were setting the marginal price of the stock were playing a different game than you were. Sixty dollars a share was a reasonable price for the traders, because they planned on selling the stock before the end of the day, when its price would probably be higher. But sixty dollars was a disaster in the making for you, because you planned on holding shares for the long run.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than we do, because an anchor of psychology is not realizing that rational people can see the world through a different lens than your own.</p>
<hr>
<p>But while we can see how much money other people spend on cars, homes, clothes, and vacations, we don’t get to see their goals, worries, and aspirations. A young lawyer aiming to be a partner at a prestigious law firm might need to maintain an appearance that I, a writer who can work in sweatpants, have no need for. But when his purchases set my own expectations, I’m wandering down a path of potential disappointment because I’m spending the money without the career boost he’s getting</p>
<hr>
<p>Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention</p>
<hr>
<p>“Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more frightening, more violent, and more hopeless—in short, more dramatic—than it really is,” Hans Rosling wrote in his book Factfulness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.</p>
<hr>
<p>Or take Bernie Madoff. In hindsight his Ponzi scheme should have been obvious. He reported returns that never varied, they were audited by a relatively unknown accounting firm, and he refused to release much information on how the returns were achieved. Yet Madoff raised billions of dollars from some of the most sophisticated investors in the world. He told a good story, and people wanted to believe it.</p>
<hr>
<p>The bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what you need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more you are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing financial fiction.</p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.</p>
<hr>
<p>Most people, when confronted with something they don’t understand, do not realize they don’t understand it because they’re able to come up with an explanation that makes sense based on their own unique perspective and experiences in the world,</p>
<hr>
<p>I might follow you blindly into a decision that’s right for you and disastrous to me.</p>
<hr>
<p>The illusion of control is more persuasive than the reality of uncertainty. So we cling to stories about outcomes being in our control.</p>
<hr>
<p>Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or more options in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful force in investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade away</p>
<hr>
<p>Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and chrome.</p>
<hr>
<p>Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical emergency. But saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save.</p>
<hr>
<p>Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free. And remember that most financial costs don’t have visible price tags. Uncertainty, doubt, and regret are common costs in the finance world.</p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone’s goals and desires will change over time, and the more extreme your past decisions were the more you may regret them as you evolve.</p>
<hr>
<p>Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game.</p>
<hr>
<p>Half of all U.S. mutual fund portfolio managers do not invest a cent of their own money in their funds, according to Morningstar</p>
<hr>
<p>The difference between what someone suggests you do and what they do for themselves isn’t always a bad thing. It just underscores that when dealing with complicated and emotional issues that affect you and your family, there is no one right answer. There is no universal truth</p>
<hr>
<p>Independence, to me, doesn’t mean you’ll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want.</p>
<hr>
<p>We own our house without a mortgage, which is the worst financial decision we’ve ever made but the best money decision we’ve ever made. Mortgage interest rates were absurdly low when we bought our house. Any rational advisor would recommend taking advantage of cheap money and investing extra savings in higher-return assets, like stock</p>
<hr>
<p>But our goal isn’t to be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable.</p>
<hr>
<p>On paper it’s defenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That’s what matters. Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point you have to choose between being happy or being “right.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Not being forced to sell stocks to cover an expense also means we’re increasing the odds of letting the stocks we own compound for the longest period of time. Charlie Munger put it well: “The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Between 1993 and 2012, the top 1 percent saw their incomes grow 86.1 percent, while the bottom 99 percent saw just 6.6 percent growth.</p>
