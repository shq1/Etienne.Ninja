# Mon résumé
Je retiens qu'il y a trois actions qu'il suggère pour la perte de poids:
* Éviter tout ce qui est sucre raffiné et glucides raffinés (pâte, pain, chips, chocolat)
* Arrêter de manger entre les repas
* Faire des jeunes sur de courtes périodes.

J'ai déjà coupé le sucre durant 8 mois et je n'ai eu aucune perte significative.
J'ai appliqué un seul conseil du livre: je mange à ma faim (même énormément), mais seulement aux repas. Je ne mange plus rien entre les repas. En deux mois j'ai enfin réussi ce que je n'avais jamais réussi en 10 ans, j'ai passé de 197-198 à 180-182 livres. Et c'était ma tentative de perte de poids la plus facile.

J'ai aussi appris que "manger moins de calories" que nécessaire est très mauvais. Tu déséquilibres ton corps avec des impacts permanents et deviens physiologiquement plus difficile de rester maigre par la suite. Ce n'est pas un manque de self control de la personne. Même après des années de moins manger sur une longue période de temps, l'hormone Ghrelin (qui nous donne faim) reste plus élevée dans le corps. Et les hormones de satiété restent plus faibles (amylin, peptine YY et cholecystokinin). Bref, ton corps n'a pas aimé cette expérience de manger moins de calories que nécessaire pour perdre du poids.

No relationship whatsoever was discovered between the weight of the adoptive parents and the adoptees. Whether adoptive parents were thin or fat made no difference to the eventual weight of the adopted child

---

Approximately 70 percent of the variance in obesity is familial.

---

But does a calorie of olive oil cause the same metabolic response as a calorie of sugar? The answer is, obviously, no

---

We obsess about caloric input into the system, but output is far more important.

---

Various hormonal levels, including ghrelin—a hormone that, essentially, makes us hungry—were analyzed. Weight loss significantly increased ghrelin levels in the study’s subjects, even after more than one year, compared to the subjects’ usual baseline.

---

More than a year after initial weight loss, the levels of all three satiety hormones were significantly lower than before.

---

People on a diet tend to feel hungrier, and that effect isn’t some kind of psychological voodoo, nor is it a loss of willpower. Increased hunger is a normal and expected hormonal response to weight loss.

---

Exercise is like brushing your teeth. It is good for you and should be done every day. Just don’t expect to lose weight.

---

there is no difference in total activity over the week between the two groups. Why? The phys ed group compensated by doing less at home. The non-phys ed group compensated by doing more when they got home.

---

If the body set weight stays at 200 pounds, the body will try to regain the lost weight by stimulating appetite. Ghrelin is increased, and the satiety hormones (amylin, peptide YY and cholecystokinin) are suppressed. At the same time, the body will decrease its total energy expenditure

---

Eating more does not make us fat. Getting fat makes us eat more.

---

Obesity is a state of leptin resistance

---

Like the wallet, glycogen is quickly able to provide glucose to the body. However, the supply of glycogen is limited. Like the bank account, fat stores contain an unlimited amount of energy, but they are harder to access.

---

Insulin levels are almost 20 percent higher in obese subjects,2 and these elevated levels are strongly correlated to important indices such as waist circumference and waist/hip ratio

---

We do not get fat because we overeat. We overeat because we get fat.” And why do we get fat? We get fat because our body set weight thermostat is set too high. Why? Because our insulin levels are too high.

---

Prolonged cortisol stimulation will raise glucose levels and, subsequently, insulin. This increase in insulin plays a substantial role in the resulting weight gain.

---

Long-term stress leads to long-term elevated cortisol levels, which leads to extra pounds.

---

Contrary to popular belief, sitting in front of the television or computer is a poor way to relieve stress. Instead, stress relief is an active process. There are many time-tested methods of stress relief, including mindfulness meditation, yoga, massage therapy and exercise.

---

What foods causes our insulin levels to rise or to spike? The most obvious candidate is the refined carbohydrate—highly refined grains and sugars

---

When we took away the carbohydrates, the patients spontaneously reduced their daily energy consumption by 1,000 calories a day.”10 Insulin levels dropped and insulin sensitivity was restored.

---

Highly refined and processed foods somehow do not trigger the release of satiety hormones, and we go ahead and eat that cake.

---

Pasta, bread, cookies, chocolate, chips. Notice anything? All are highly refined carbohydrates

---

Macaroni and cheese. Pasta. Ice cream. Apple pie. Mashed potatoes. Pancakes. Notice anything? All are highly refined carbohydrates

---

A systematic review of all the dietary trials showed that much of the benefits of a low-carbohydrate approach evaporated after one year.

---

One of the founding principles of the low-carbohydrate approach is that dietary carbohydrates increase blood sugars the most. High blood sugars lead to high insulin. High insulin is the key driver of obesity. Those facts seem reasonable enough. What was wrong?

---

The longer you are obese, the more insulin resistance you have

---

Insulin resistance requires persistently high levels. The nightly fasting caused periods of very low insulin, so resistance could not develop. One of the key factors in obesity’s development was removed

---

But avoid sugars and refined carbohydrates

---

So should we eat more fruits and vegetables? Yes, definitely. But only if they are replacing other unhealthier foods in your diet. Replace. Not add

---

refined carbohydrates

---

Those children who were very active in school reduced their activity at home. Children relatively sedentary at school increased their activity once out of school.

---

Reducing the use of sugar-sweetened beverages is a highly effective method of preventing childhood obesity.

---

but also increases the risk of developing diabetes by 83 percent compared to drinking less than one sugar-sweetened drink per month

---

GLUCOSE, A SUGAR with the basic molecular structure of a six-sided ring, can be used by virtually every cell in the body

---

Fructose, a sugar with the basic molecular structure of a five-sided ring, is found naturally in fruit

---

glycemic index measures blood glucose, not blood insulin levels.

---

During non-fasting days, stick to a nutritious diet low in sugars and refined carbohydrates.
